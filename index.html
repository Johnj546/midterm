  <h1><b>Computer programming</b></h1>
  <p> Computer programming (often shortened to <b>programming</b> )is a process that leads from an original formulation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing" target="_blank">computing</a> problem to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable" target="_blank">executable</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program" target="_blank">computer programs</a>.
  Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank">algorithms</a>, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness
  and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as <b>coding</b>) of algorithms in a target <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target="_blank">programming language</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor" target="_blank">Source code</a> is written in one or more
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target="_blank">programming languages</a>. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The 
  process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_domain" target="_blank">application domain</a>, specialized algorithms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" target="_blank">formal logic</a>.
  </p>
  <p> Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term <b><i>programming, implementation, or coding</i></b>reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.

  <h1 id="Overview"> Overview</h1>
  	<a> Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one phase in a software development process.
	There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art form, a craft, or an engineering discipline.[3] In general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three, with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria for "efficient" and "evolvable" vary considerably). The discipline differs from many other technical professions in that programmers, in general, do not need to be licensed or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to call themselves "programmers" or even "software engineers." Because the discipline covers many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole. In most cases, the discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming, and sometimes very strict environments are defined (e.g. United States Air Force use of AdaCore and security clearance). However, representing oneself as a "professional software engineer" without a license from an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world.
	Another ongoing debate is the extent to which the programming language used in writing computer programs affects the form that the final program takes.[citation needed] This debate is analogous to that surrounding the Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis[4] in linguistics and cognitive science, which postulates that a particular spoken language's nature influences the habitual thought of its speakers. Different language patterns yield different patterns of thought. This idea challenges the possibility of representing the world perfectly with language, because it acknowledges that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker community.</a>
  <h1 id="History">History</h1>
  	<a>Ancient cultures seemed to have no conception of computing beyond arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, occasionally devising computational systems with elements of calculus (e.g. the method of exhaustion). The only mechanical device that existed for numerical computation at the beginning of human history was the abacus, invented in Sumeria circa 2500 BC. Later, the Antikythera mechanism, invented some time around 100 BC in ancient Greece, is the first known mechanical calculator utilizing gears of various sizes and configuration to perform calculations,[5] which tracked the metonic cycle still used in lunar-to-solar calendars, and which is consistent for calculating the dates of the Olympiads.[6]
	The medieval scientist Al-Jazari built programmable automata in 1206 AD. One system employed in these devices was the use of pegs and cams placed into a wooden drum at specific locations, which would sequentially trigger levers that in turn operated percussion instruments. The output of this device was a small drummer playing various rhythms and drum patterns.[7] The Jacquard loom, which Joseph Marie Jacquard developed in 1801, uses a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them. The hole pattern represented the pattern that the loom had to follow in weaving cloth. The loom could produce entirely different weaves using different sets of cards.
	Charles Babbage adopted the use of punched cards around 1830 to control his Analytical Engine. Mathematician Ada Lovelace, a friend of Babbage, between 1842 and 1843 translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine,[8] which she supplemented with a set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes include an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers,[9] intended to be carried out by a machine. Despite controversy over scope of her contribution, many consider this algorithm to be the first computer program.[8]</a>
